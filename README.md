## The Problem: AI Agents Running Wild

When companies deploy dozens of AI agents via Archestra:

- **Agent A** calls GPT-4 **500x in an hour** → Burns **$450** before anyone notices
- **Agent B** accesses a **production database** it shouldn't touch → Security incident
- **Agent C** hits **rate limits** in an infinite loop → System downtime
- **Platform engineers have no visibility** until the damage is done

**The gap:** Agents run fast, but **nobody's watching the watchers.**

---

## The Solution: SentinelMCP

**An MCP agent that audits OTHER agents.**

SentinelMCP ingests activity logs from AI agents and flags violations in real-time:

- 💰 **Cost violations** — Agent spending spikes, runaway API costs
- 🔒 **Security violations** — Unauthorized access, credential leaks
- ⚡ **Rate limit abuse** — Excessive API calls, quota exhaustion
- ⚠️ **Anomalies** — Infinite loops, repeated errors

**Output:** Structured audit report with risk score (0-100) and actionable recommendations.

---

## Why This Matters (And Why It Wins)

### 1. **Meta-Level MCP** (Judges Love This)
Using MCP to **govern MCP agents** is elegant. SentinelMCP is itself an MCP tool that monitors other MCP tools.

### 2. **Solves Archestra's Core Value Prop**
Archestra promises: *"governance, security, and observability for AI agents at scale."*  
SentinelMCP **proves** that promise by:
- **Detecting cost overruns** before they spiral
- **Flagging security violations** in real-time
- **Providing observability** across multi-agent systems

### 3. **Painful, Real Problem**
Platform engineers managing 50+ agents in production **feel** this pain:
- "Our AI bill jumped from $2k to $15k last month—why?"
- "An agent accessed prod DB with write permissions—how?"
- "We need audit trails for compliance."

SentinelMCP answers all three.

### 4. **Production-Ready Design**
- **Read-only:** Only analyzes logs; never modifies agents
- **Structured output:** Pydantic models with risk scores
- **Tool boundaries:** Clear MCP contract for governance
- **Archestra-native:** Designed to run as a central auditor in the control plane

## Architecture

### Before SentinelMCP
```
Archestra Platform
  ├─ Agent A → calls gpt-4 500x → burns $450 💸
  ├─ Agent B → accesses prod DB → security risk 🔓
  └─ Agent C → infinite loop → nobody notices ♾️
```

### With SentinelMCP

```

**Key:** SentinelMCP runs **inside Archestra** as a governance layer. All agent activity flows through audit checks.

## Security & Governance Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Tool-level isolation** | SentinelMCP has ONE function: `audit_agent_activity()` |
| **Read-only** | Only reads logs; cannot modify agents or infrastructure |
| **Structured output** | Pydantic models; no free-form agent actions |
| **Multi-agent observability** | Tracks violations across all agents in one report |
| **Cost control** | Flags spending thresholds before bills explode |
| **Security enforcement** | Detects unauthorized access, credential leaks |
| **Archestra-native** | Designed as control plane component, not standalone |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>

## Demo Video Script (2-3 min)

**[0:00-0:30] Problem**  
"When you run 50 AI agents in production, one agent can burn $10k in a day—and you won't know until the bill comes. SentinelMCP solves this."

**[0:30-1:00] Architecture**  
*Show diagram* "Agents run in Archestra. SentinelMCP audits their activity logs via MCP and flags cost, security, and operational violations."

**[1:00-2:00] Demo**  
*Terminal:* `curl /audit` with sample logs → show JSON response with CRITICAL violations + recommendations.

**[2:00-2:30] Why Archestra**  
"Without Archestra, this is chaos—50 agents, 50 separate audit systems. With Archestra, SentinelMCP runs centrally and governs everything. That's the power of MCP + control plane."

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+** (MCP-native language)
- **FastAPI** (ASGI server, production-ready)
- **Pydantic** (structured output, type safety)
